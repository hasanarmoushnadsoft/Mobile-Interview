## Requirements

Develop a full feed containing interactive posts in accordance to the following requirements.

- Fork this repo before making any changes
- Frequently commit your changes to GIT, with proper messages on each commit.
- Colors should be the same hex/rgb values that appear within the screenshots
- Code should be well documented, with adequate comments explaining relevant sections.
- Designs should scale down to at least iPhone 5 (preferrably using AutoLayout)
- Create each post contained within the feed.
- You do not need to include comments under each post.
- Ignore all animations. The zoom in effect that appears when tapping an image does not need to be replicated, nor do you have to make it so that you can swipe on the image to get to the next.
- Use high resolution dummy images for profile pictures and post pictures
- Find equivalent icons in place of icons present within the design
- Tapping on an image in the feed should enlarge the image. The enlarged image can appear within a popup and does not need to transition from the feed. 
- Tapping on the user profile picture and post icons does not need to go anywhere nor do anything. 
- Using REST/XHR make a request to your choice of an API to pull photos/posts (e.g. News RSS feed or LOREM IPSUM like image generator). 
- Style the image popup as you wish. Tapping outside the image should remove the image from view.

### BONUS:
- Add a PanGesture to the image within the popup allowing you to drag it around.
